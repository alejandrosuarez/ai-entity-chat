# Today's Work Summary - 2025-07-25

## 🎯 Main Objective: Fix "More from this owner" Feature + Comprehensive Bug Fixes

## 📋 Major Accomplishments

### 1. **API Endpoint Development**
- ✅ Created `/api/entities/[id]/owner-entities/route.ts` - Wrapper endpoint for fetching entities by same owner
- ✅ Created `/api/entities/[id]/stats/route.ts` - Statistics endpoint for entity analytics  
- ✅ Created `/api/entities/[id]/related/route.ts` - Related entities endpoint
- ✅ Created `/api/interaction_logs/route.ts` - Interaction logging and retrieval endpoint
- ✅ Created `/api/my/route.ts` - User's own entities endpoint

### 2. **UI Components & Features**
- ✅ Created `OwnerEntitiesTab.tsx` - Component for displaying other entities by same owner
- ✅ Enhanced `entity-detail-modal.tsx` with tabbed interface (Info, Owner, Share, Settings)
- ✅ Created comprehensive entity detail page at `/[locale]/entities/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added Tabs UI component (`src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`)
- ✅ Moved Contact Owner button from Settings to Info tab for better UX

### 3. **Authentication & OTP Integration**
- ✅ Tested and verified OTP authentication flow
- ✅ Integrated authentication with interaction logs
- ✅ Added auth-protected statistics features

### 4. **Critical Bug Fixes - Parameter Naming Audit**
- 🐛 **MAJOR FIX**: Identified and fixed camelCase/snake_case parameter inconsistencies
  - Fixed `src/app/api/interaction_logs/route.ts` - `entityId` → `entity_id`
  - Fixed `src/app/api/entities/[id]/stats/route.ts` - `entityId` → `entity_id`  
  - Fixed `src/app/[locale]/entities/[id]/page.tsx` - `entityId` → `entity_id`
- ✅ **Result**: Interaction logs now return real data instead of empty results

### 5. **Data Flow & Integration**
- ✅ Verified remote API endpoints work correctly with authentication
- ✅ Fixed statistics processing to show real interaction data
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Added debug logging for troubleshooting

### 6. **Frontend Enhancements**
- ✅ Added tabbed interface for entity details (Other Entities, Related, Statistics, Announcements)
- ✅ Implemented auto-loading of tab data when entity loads
- ✅ Added comprehensive statistics dashboard with charts and breakdowns
- ✅ Enhanced modal with Contact Owner functionality
- ✅ Added proper loading states and error handling

### 7. **Internationalization**
- ✅ Updated `messages/en.json` and `messages/es.json` with new translation keys
- ✅ Ensured all new components are fully internationalized
